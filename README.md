# Cowin Vaccination Slot Availability Search

Very simple to use and basic Jupyter Notebook code to keep searching , find and notify the availability of the Covid Vaccination slot in India.

Just download the two file and keep them in the same folder
1. Cowin-Availability-Functions.ipynb
2. Cowin-Availability-Run.ipynb

Open the Cowin-Availability-Run file.

Set the search parameters and Run All -  

1. Age Limit (values should be 18 or 45)
2. Minimum availability (value should be 1 or more)
3. List of districts to search against, you can provide one district or multiple districts. I am not using Pin code as within a district there can be multiple pin codes and usually people are fine to visit any nearly center even if it is in other pin codes.
I have also given small fuction to search for the district ids as they are inital keys for the Cowin.

Hope you get the best slot soon and be safe !!!


P.S. For any errors or issues in running, please notify me.
